# QuasarADW
Simulates a radiation-driven quasar accretion disk wind model. A normalized absorption spectrum is generated and is used to identify different characteristics of the synthetic quasar such as the depth of absorption, velocity at which the maximum absorption occurs, minimum and maximum velocities, and absorption at FWHM. These features can be directly compared to the observed data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasar Spectral Database.
